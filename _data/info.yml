about: >-
  I am a machine learning enthusiast with a passion for reproducible data science, deep learning, and human-computer interaction.
  I received my BS (Computer Science) from University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.
  I'm currently a PhD student at Old Dominion University, USA, where I explore methods to improve data reusability, reproducibility, interactivity, and functionality of stream-based scientific workflows through metadata propagation and deep learning.
  I'm open for Summer Internships in Machine Learning Research, Data Science Research, DevOps, or Software Development.
