  term: 2019
  description: |-
    Using EEG and Thermography data to predict a diagnosis of ASD.
    Here, EEG signals were first pre-processed.
    Simultaneously, features were extracted from Thermography data.
    Next, a wavelet transformation was applied on each EEG signal to generate features.
    Machine learning models were then trained from these features to predict a diagnosis of ASD.

    Estimating the rate of change of the academic web using archived copies of web pages.
    Here, archived copies are first obtained from the Internet Archive through its CDX Server API.
    Next, for each web page, archived copies are analyzed to detect when changes have occurred.
    These changes are then modeled as a poisson process, and used to predict when a page is likely to change in the future.
